AI-Programs
===========

This is a testing ground for playing with new languages, and for implementing various AI techniques, just for kicks.

Sudoku: Solves sudoko puzzles. Written in Prolog, this program can be run directly from a standard Prolog interpreter. 

RushHour: Solves the RushHour (aka, Traffic) puzzle. Written in Haskell, this program can be run directly from a standard Haskell interpreter.

Both of these started as class projects, which I improved to solve harder puzzles. Originally, both used brute-force DFS exclusively. I modified the sudoku solver to mimic my own personal sudoku strategy, and replaced the DFS search in RushHour with an A* implementation. At some point I'd like to use these along with a simple GUI to make complete mini-games!
